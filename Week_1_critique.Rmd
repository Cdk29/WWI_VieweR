## Weakness

*What do you see as a significant weakness of this visualization? How could you improve it to make it clearer, easier to understand, or more impactful? Make sure you provide some detail in justifying your answer.*

### Colors palettes
Two differents colors of palettes should have been used for eachs graphs. Instead, here, one palette is just a subdued version of the other. 
This lead to the misleading assuption that there is a relationship between the categories of the two graphs. For example, there is not relationships between *DDOS Attack* and *FDS - Scan*.


Subdued colors should be only used to create accent color scales, as developped here : https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/color-basics.html

I would have use a totally different palette, with orange and other colors not present in the first graph.

## Strength

*What do you see as a strength of this visualization? Is there a specific choice of the designer that made it especially useful or impactful? Make sure you provide some detail in justifying your answer.*


* The type of the graph used : a circular barplot. Even if this type of graphs are visually appealing, they are hard to use properly. Here, this use is plainly justified : there is several grouping variable (Malware, Forged Documents), and the plot make it is easy to compare groups as well as entities into each group.
* They cut the visualization into two graphs based on their price scale, the second graph having only categories with small range of price (1\$ to 165\$). This split of the data make more things more readable and price more easy to compare.


Also, circular barcharts make sense we you have a huge number of bar to display, which is the case here.
