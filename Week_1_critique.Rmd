## Weakness

*What do you see as a significant weakness of this visualization? How could you improve it to make it clearer, easier to understand, or more impactful? Make sure you provide some detail in justifying your answer.*

### Colors palettes
Two differents colors of palettes for eachs graphs : one palette is just a subdued version of the other. 
This lead to think that there is a relationship between the two variables 


subdued should be only used for ... accent color scales, as developped here : https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/color-basics.html
## Strength

What do you see as a strength of this visualization? Is there a specific choice of the designer that made it especially useful or impactful? Make sure you provide some detail in justifying your answer.

* cut into two graph based on prices scale
* The type of the graph used : a circular barplot. Even if this type of graphs are visually appealing, they are hard to use properly. Here, this use is plainly justified : there is several grouping variable, and the plot make it is easy to compare groups as well as entities into each group.

Also, circular barcharts make sense we you have a huge number of bar to display, which is the case here.
